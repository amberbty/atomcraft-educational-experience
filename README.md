# Design for Emerging Technologies (DET), Stockholm University VT24 Lab Session 4: Unity-Esp32 Communication
 This repository serves as a template to help students create their own IOT apps using ESP32 and Meta Quest HMDs running applications using the Unity Game Engine.

## What You Will Do in This Project

In this educational experience, you will take part in an immersive activity where you build atoms through physical and virtual interaction.

As a user, you will:

- **Choose an element** you want to build (for example, hydrogen, helium, or lithium) through an intuitive **VR interface**.  
- **Press physical buttons** to create **protons, neutrons, and electrons**, each appearing as interactive particles in the virtual environment.  
- **Grab and throw** these particles toward the assembly area on the virtual table to combine them and form the chosen atom.  
- **Observe the atom forming** as particles come together with dynamic visual and sound effects.  
- **Experiment freely** with different combinations to explore how changing the number of particles affects the type of atom formed.

This experience helps you intuitively understand **how atomic structures are built**, making abstract science tangible and engaging through direct, hands-on interaction.
